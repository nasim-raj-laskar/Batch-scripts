## тЪая╕П Description:
This script simulates a RAM overflow scenario by overloading system memory. It is useful for testing system behavior under memory stress, but **extreme caution is advised**.

## ЁЯЪА Usage:
1. Double-click `RAM-overflow.bat` to run the script.
2. You can edit the script to control how much memory it consumes and for how long.

## тЪая╕П Warning:
- This script can cause your system to become unresponsive, slow down, or crash.
- Only run this in a **virtual machine** or **non-production environment**.
- Do **not** run this on important systems as it may cause system instability.

## Example:
```bash
RAM-overflow.bat   # This will start consuming system memory until it's overloaded.
