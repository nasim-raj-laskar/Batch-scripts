# space-eating Script

## 💣 Description:
This batch script rapidly consumes disk space by creating large files. It is useful for testing disk space exhaustion scenarios.

## 🚀 Usage:
1. Double-click the script to start consuming disk space.
2. The script will continue to create files until the disk is full or the script is terminated.
3. To stop the script, close the terminal window or use Task Manager to kill the process.

## ⚠️ Warning:
- This script can lead to **complete disk space exhaustion**, resulting in system crashes or critical failures.
- Run this in a **test system** or **virtual machine** only.
- Once the disk is full, it may be difficult to recover the system.
