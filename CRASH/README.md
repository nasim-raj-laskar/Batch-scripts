# Unlimited Background Process Maker

## ⚙️ Description:
This script creates an unlimited number of background processes, rapidly consuming system resources until the system crashes. It is useful for stress-testing your CPU and system's process management capabilities.

## 🚀 Usage:
1. Double-click `unli-proc.bat` to run the script.
2. The script will spawn infinite background processes, eventually leading to a system crash.
3. Manually terminate the script or reboot the system if it becomes unresponsive.

## ⚠️ Warning:
- **This script will overwhelm your CPU with processes**, leading to high CPU usage and system instability.
- Use this script in a **test environment** or **virtual machine**.
- **Rebooting the system** may be necessary to stop the processes once they take over.
